### NEWS web site
This project is going to implement a system that gather information from NEWS web site and shows them in one place.
### Technologies
For server side application we use [python][python_web_page] as programing language and [django][django_web_page] as a web development framework for python. As we use django ORM for creating models, back-end storage can be everything django ORM supports. ([MySQL][mysql_web_page] or SQLite for example). For crawling we use [Scrapy][scrapy_web_page].



[django_web_page]: https://www.djangoproject.com/
[python_web_page]: https://www.python.org
[mysql_web_page]: https://www.mysql.com/
[scrapy_web_page]: https://scrapy.org/
